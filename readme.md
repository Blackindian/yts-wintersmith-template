# YTS Wintersmith Template
## Introduction

Your Trade Site websites are created using a app called Wintersmith.
It is a static site generator that takes the files produced from the YTS web form and compiles them into several files that are the website.

## How to use

1) Clone this repo to generate a blank template. Identify new folder by ID number.
2) Copy the following files generated by the web form to the locations where '/' is the base directory:
    - index.md -> /contents
    - locals.json -> /
    - variables.scss -> /contents/css/
3) Open a terminal and navigate to the base directory.
4) Enter the command: "wintersmith build"
5) Upload the files in the 'build' folder to the server
6) Check it all worked :)
